# Technical Showcase: Application Support & Product Operations

## 🎯 Overview

In Product Operations, the priority is maintaining the bridge between complex software logic and reliable business outcomes. These labs demonstrate my ability to support cloud-based platforms through **data integrity auditing**, **automated system reliability**, and **secure application lifecycles**.

## 🛠️ Featured Product Operations Labs

### 1. [SQL Integrity Lab: Fintech Data Auditing](https://github.com/JennyCloud/fintech-ops-sql-lab)
**Ops Focus:** *Product Stability & Data Accuracy*
* **The Problem:** Application-level bugs can occasionally allow invalid data (e.g., negative loan balances) into production tables, causing downstream reporting errors.
* **The Solution:** A SQL-based audit suite that identifies transactional anomalies and "orphaned" records in a lending environment.
* **Key Skill:** Demonstrates the ability to perform deep-dive data investigation—a core responsibility for an Application Support Analyst.

### 2. [PowerShell Lab: Self-Healing Application Monitor](https://github.com/JennyCloud/powershell-self-healing-monitor)
**Ops Focus:** *Infrastructure Reliability & Uptime*
* **The Problem:** Critical application services (like web listeners or payment processors) can hang or crash, leading to service interruptions.
* **The Solution:** A "Self-Healing" monitor that proactively polls service health and automatically triggers recovery actions before a user reports an issue.
* **Key Skill:** Shows a proactive approach to application support, moving from "reactive" fixing to "automated" prevention.

### 3. [HelpHub: Full-Stack Application Lifecycle & CI/CD](https://github.com/JennyCloud/helphub-app)
**Ops Focus:** *Application Deployment & Secure Automation*
* **The Problem:** Manual deployments of .NET applications are prone to human error and "configuration drift," while managing static credentials in CI/CD pipelines creates security vulnerabilities.
* **The Solution:** A .NET cloud service deployed via **Bicep (IaC)** and **GitHub Actions** using **OIDC** for secure, passwordless authentication to Azure.
* **Key Skill:** Demonstrates a complete understanding of the .NET application lifecycle and modern DevSecOps practices—ensuring that product updates are deployed safely and consistently.

## 🚀 Why I am a fit for Inovatec Product Operations
As a "key member of the Product Operations Team," I bring a blend of technical execution and an operational mindset:

* **Proactive Troubleshooting:** I don't just wait for tickets; I build monitors to catch issues early.
* **Full-Stack Awareness:** I understand the relationship between C#/.NET application logic and the underlying Azure infrastructure.
* **Data-Driven Support:** I use SQL to validate that the product is behaving exactly as the business logic intends.
* **Documentation First:** Every solution I build is documented for the team, ensuring knowledge is shared and scalable.

## 🎯 Overview
This repository serves as a targeted technical portfolio for the **Application Support Analyst** role within the **Product Operations Team** at Inovatec. 

In Product Operations, the priority is maintaining the bridge between complex software logic and reliable business outcomes. These labs demonstrate my ability to support cloud-based lending platforms through **data integrity auditing** and **automated system reliability**.

## 🛠️ Featured Product Operations Labs

### 1. [SQL Integrity Lab: Fintech Data Auditing](https://github.com/JennyCloud/fintech-ops-sql-lab)

* **Key Skill:** Demonstrates the ability to perform deep-dive data investigation—a core responsibility for an Application Support Analyst.

### 2. [PowerShell Lab: Self-Healing Application Monitor](https://github.com/JennyCloud/powershell-self-healing-monitor)
**Ops Focus:** *Infrastructure Reliability & Uptime*
* **The Problem:** Critical application services (like web listeners or payment processors) can hang or crash, leading to service interruptions.
* **The Solution:** A "Self-Healing" monitor that proactively polls service health and automatically triggers recovery actions before a user reports an issue.
* **Key Skill:** Shows a proactive approach to application support, moving from "reactive" fixing to "automated" prevention.
